# Synthax Problem Statements

First of all thank you for choosing the problems, we will have two problems based on difficulty.

Choose Either of the Problems.

## Problems

### 1. Classification of ASL (American Sign language) {Beginner Level}

The Following is a basic level problem related to Classification of images.
We Will be using Neural Networks, understand the basics and then implement them to classify the images in corresponding classes.
The ASL Dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet)

#### Requirements:
  1. Basic of Python (Compulsory)
  2. File Handling
  3. Understanding Notebook Environments
  4. Basic Stats and Mathematics (Optional; but will help you)
  

### 2. Implementing DCGAN using Tensorflow 2.0 {Intermediate Level}

In this problem we will go throw the basics of a GAN network, making a Normalised Synthetic Dataset;
And then we will put all those together to create a **DC GAN**

#### Requirements:
1. Image Perception
2. Basic Understanding of Matrix
3. All the requirements of Problem 1

No need to download any Dataset for this.
